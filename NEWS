What's new in 0.1.3+SVN version?

* Bans lists.

    It is possible now to fetch list of banned account, players and IP addresses. Accounts and players can be found at OTS_Toolbox ( bannedPlayers() and bannedAccount() methods). IPs list can be take by OTS::bannedIPs().

* Separated make targets for POT package and it's documentation.

    Documentation in PDF format is very huge and it used to oversize POT package. Now it is in separated package.

* More stricted parameters and results types.

    Many methods will now throw exceptions instead of returning mixed types of results.

* Added display driver interface for non-database resources.

    Except IOTS_Display there is now also IOTS_DataDisplay which defines interface for providing display information for OTS resources that are not loaded from database (mostly from data/ directory).

* Added existence checking methods.

    As fetching methods now throws exceptions, before using them you might need to check if item you want to fetch exists.

* Added __get() and __set() methods to OTS_Admin.

    I forgot to add that in previous release after finishing work on OTS_Admin class itself.

* Code optimalisation.

    Removed some unrequired calls and dropped some blocks that was not required.

* Bugfixes.
