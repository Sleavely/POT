What's new in 0.1.6+SVN version?

* Updated OTAdmin client (server saving and opening).

    OTS_Admin::save() and OTS_Admin::open() methods are provided. It is now possible to executed full server saving cycle using POT.

* Updated binay format support.

    Updated OTBM loader for new file format. It now handles waypoints (literaly _handles_, not only _not breaks at them_). After loading map you can fetch map ways by OTS_OTBMFile::getWaypoints() which will result array of ways of OTS_Waypoint objects. Also added contants for new item attributes.

* Bugfixes.

    As always.
