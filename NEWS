What's new in 0.2.0+SVN version?

* Dropped 0.0.x and 0.1.x deprecations.

    There were many elements that lasted from the very first release of PHP OTServ Toolkit and they caused big mess in code. All of them have been dropped out (code that used deprecated methods/constants will not work!).

* Dropped PHP 5.0 support.

    PHP 5.0 is ancient. Does anyone still uses it? If so then POT won't run there. Not a big loss anyway - PHP 5.0 lacked many new capabilities like array typehinting, PDO, improved SPL library and many many more.

* Made POT class static.

    POT main class is now set of static methods - no need to instantize it and/or using it's singleton. You in fact should not do that anymore.

* Fixed loading instants in player spells.

    Just a typo in code.

* Lots of bugs reported by Junkfood fixed.

    Great thanks to Junkfood for reporting them.
