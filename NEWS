What's new in 0.0.2 version?

* Added skills support.

    You have now getSkill()/setSkill() methods in OTS_Player class.

* Added 'info' request handling.

    You have now POT::serverStatus() method which queries server for it's status. It returns special object (which is DOMDocument instance) with methods for easy data retrival. Remember that thismethod operates on sockets I/O so connection problems will results in warning messages. You will probably want to silence it with @ operator.

* Added find() to OTS_Account.

    This method load account by it's e-mail address. You can now check if given e-mail address has already been used.

* No more need for __autoload().

    POT class now automaticly registers own __autoload() handler so it will load all it's clases silently. Just include OTS.php file and use POT freely.

* Compatibility library.

    For people who use PHP verion from before 5.1.2. Compatibility assurance library ("compat") is in separated compat.php file. You have to include it BEFORE OTS.php inclusion in otder to prevent POT from causing FATAL errors on PHP earlier then 5.1.2.

* Fixed password parameter problem with DB_MYSQL driver.

    It was impossible to log into database with password as it was assigning parameter name to it. Fixed.

* Fixed `redskulltime` filed in OTS_Player.

    Simple typo. Fixed.
