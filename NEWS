What's new in 0.0.3 version?

* Added custom fields support.

    You can now use POT with non-standard SVN database structure (however it is not as comfortable as with standard SVN fields). You have to save your standard record before saving custom fields.

* Added items and depots support.

    OTS_Item and OTS_Container classes. OTS_Player now has getSlot(), setSlot(), getDepot(), setDepot() methods. You can manage items tables as objects trees.

* Added support for players PACC timestamps.

    In current OTServ SVN premium time is not stored in accounts table, but in players table also not as days, but as ending moment timestamp. Account PACC methods are now obsolete.

* Fixed loading skills.

    Small typo.

* Replaced E_USER_* with exceptions.

    No more error messages between text on website, everything is now thrown as exceptions.

* Uses fetchAll() in loops to prevent MySQL buffering problems.

    PDO is really fucked up in some places and MySQL driver queries buffering is one of them. This change should prevent POT from producing some errors in very particular situations.
