What's new in 0.1.2+SVN version?

* getStorage()/setStorage() methods in OTS_Player class.

    As requested by Proglin on http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=108150.

* More secured.

    Added some more stricted types controll. "Hey, you said POT is safe?!" - Yes it has always been safe, but now it is more idiot-friendly :P (in safety context) in code-based part.
