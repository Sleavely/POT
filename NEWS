What's new in 0.0.4 version?

* Added guild system support (guilds, ranks, invitations and requests drivers mechanisms).

    Main feature of new update - includes full support for guilds system.

* Added account group support.

    Support for new accounts table structure.

* Added support for depot_id field (it is reserverd in OTServ for futher use).

    Even thought depot_id field in OTServ database is not used, it was moved back as it is reserved for further use. POT also supports it.

    POT supports new revdbsys database drivers.

    Magic PHP5 method - you can read more in PHP Manual.

* Updated players table structure.

    As always POT keeps your scripts up-to-date with support for latest structure of database.

* Dropped REGEXP operator bindings - not used anywhere.

    This internal feature wasn't used anywhere so it would be a waste to keep it out there.

* Fixed items loading and saving.

    Items saving (both body slots and depot items) in previous versions was coded wrong way. Fixed now.

* Fixed typos.

    Like always there were some bugs which of course were fixed.
