What's new in 0.1.2 version?

* OTAdmin protocol support.

    Full OTAdmin support including RSA and XTEA encryption, keys negotiations and logging in. All currently available OTAdmin commands (BROADCAST, CLOSE_SERVER, PAY_HOUSES and SHUTDOWN_SERVER) supported.

* Supports bank balance.

    POT is always as up-to-date as it is possible. OTServ introduced new way of storing money in game - bank account like in real Tibia. It uses new database field. OTS_Player class contains new methods: getBalance() and setBalance(int $balance). $balance virtual property can be also used as an alias to those methods.

* getStorage()/setStorage() methods in OTS_Player class.

    As requested by Proglin on http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=108150.

* More secured.

    Added some more stricted types controll. "Hey, you said POT is safe?!" - Yes it has always been safe, but now it is more idiot-friendly :P (in safety context) in code-based part.

* Fixed buffered streams to use little-endian storage (like Open Tibia does).

    Until now buffered streams used machine-dependent bits order which could produce problems while using POT on big-endian machines. Mainly when trying to use them for protocol packets. Now it's fixed to use always little-endian bits order.

* Implemented NetworkMessage.

    NetworkMessage class is realised in POT by OTS_Buffer class. It contains streamed reading and writing methods. Thought it is not fully same that C++ NetworkMessage class. Mainly because any enryption, decryption and header-connected routines were moved to connection handling classes.
