List of things to be done:

* List objects sorting/criteria-based loading.
* Bans support.
* Items list (items.xml + items.otb -> cache).
* Spawns support (OTBM support -> cache).
* More detailed documentation, better examples, more detailed phpUnit tests.
* Implement __getters/__setters/__callers; Iterator, ArrayAccess, Countable interfaces.
