List of things to be done:

* List objects sorting/criteria-based loading.
* Nice items management, with containers tree.
* Guilds, guild management.
* Items list (items.xml + items.otb -> cache).
* Spawns support (OTBM support -> cache).
* More detailed documentation, better examples, more detailed phpUnit tests.
